# EduGuard

EduGuard is a PaperMC plugin for Minecraft Java Edition designed to manage class schedules and automate various in-game actions based on those schedules. It provides features such as automatic kicking of players, enabling/disabling the whitelist, and resetting the in-game day time based on predefined class end times.

## Features

- **Automatic Kicking**: Automatically kicks players at the end of class.
- **Whitelist Management**: Enables and disables the whitelist around class end times to prevent rejoins.
- **Day Time Reset**: Resets the in-game day time based on class schedules so each session has a similar experience.
- **Profanity Filter**: Built in profanity filtering for chat messages and usernames.
- **Configurable Settings**: All features are highly configurable through a YAML configuration file.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/megabyte6/EduGuard/releases/latest) the latest release of EduGuard.
2. Place the `.jar` file in your Minecraft server's `plugins` directory.
3. Start your server to generate the default configuration files.
4. Configure the plugin by editing the `config.yml` file located in the `plugins/EduGuard` directory.
